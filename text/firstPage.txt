Thomas Royal: Programmer

I have been addicted to computers and technology
ever since I was 8 years old and created on my 
first program on an old TRS-80. Ever since then, 
technology has been an important part of my life.
I love the ability to create something new out
of thin air using numbers and logic. 

This website contains the following:

- A brief introduction to who I am as a programmer (the current page)
- A portfolio of recent programming projects
- A list of commonly used HTML5 tags

What interests me most about creating software is the
process of design. I believe it is important to start
from the stand point of the user and how he or she interacts
with data through well designed interfaces. I believe
that algorithms, design patterns, infrastructure, and even testing
should all serve a well-clarified vision of the experience 
of the user.

I am currently open to collaborating with other 
developers. If you are interested in collaborating, please
contact me or look at my Github to see if I'm up to snuff!
