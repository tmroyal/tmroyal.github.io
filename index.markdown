I have done a lot of loosely related stuff. See previous iterations of this site on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130901000000*/tmroyal.com) for an idea of how I've spent my life. Here is a description of how I spend it currently.

(Note: at the time of writing this, it seems that the Wayback Machine is down. They've had some [security issues](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159000/internet-archive-hack-leak-wayback-machine) lately.)

## Developer

I am currently working as a backend engineer at [Feathr](https://www.feathr.co). Much of my work involves API integrations with Blackbaud, iMIS, AWS/Pinpoint and other services in support of a marketing platform for non-profits. We work with Flask, MongoDB/mongoengine and ElasticSearch and some in house tools for job processing.

## Pianist

I am a jazz pianist. From 2012 to 2021 my income was from performing and teaching jazz piano in and around Gainesville. I have done less of that since becoming a developer but I still often perform with [Nick DeCarlis](http://www.jazzcor.net/). I love Ahmad Jamahl, Bill Evans, Duke Ellington, Red Garland and Chick Corea.

## Composer 

I received my Ph.D. in Music Composition from University of Florida in 2014. My dissertation discussed modalities for interpreting performance involving computer music using theories of play. I continue to write algorithmic music and will begin releasing this music when it is good enough for me. Some preliminary ideas can be seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thomasroyal9448). Future releases are likely to be anonymous.

## Hobbies

Cycling, A.I. Mathematics, recently global capital.
